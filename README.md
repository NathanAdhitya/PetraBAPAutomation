# PetraBAPAutomation

Current features:

- newline/space seperated NRP entries to be automatically marked as hadir/alpa/sakit/izin

This userscript can be run with the Chrome/Edge/Firefox extension TamperMonkey.  
For now (at least), simply copy paste from the script PetraBAPAutomation.js located in the index of this repository into your TamperMonkey scripts.

A button with the text "Automation" should appear on the bottom controls.
